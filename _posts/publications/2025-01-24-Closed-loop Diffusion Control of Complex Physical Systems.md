title: "CL-DiffPhyCon: Closed-loop Diffusion Control of Complex Physical Systems"
image: "/assets/img/publications/CDCCPS.png"
tag: "ML for physical control"
summary: We propose a diffusion method with an asynchronous denoising schedule for physical systems control tasks. It achieves closed-loop control with significant speedup of sampling efficiency.
