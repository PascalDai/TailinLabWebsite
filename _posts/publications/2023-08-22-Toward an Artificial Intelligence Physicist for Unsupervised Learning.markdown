summary: "We introduced a paradigm and algorithms for learning theories (small, interpretable models together with domain classifier) each specializing in explaining aspects of a dynamical system. It combines four inductive biases from physicists: divide-and-conquer, Occam’s razor with MDL, unification and lifelong learning."
