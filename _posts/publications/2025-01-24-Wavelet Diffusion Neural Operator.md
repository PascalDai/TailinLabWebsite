title: "Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator"
image: "/assets/img/publications/WDNO.png"
tag: "ML for simulation & control"
summary: We propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO), a novel method for generative PDE simulation and control, to address diffusion models’ challenges of modeling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions.
