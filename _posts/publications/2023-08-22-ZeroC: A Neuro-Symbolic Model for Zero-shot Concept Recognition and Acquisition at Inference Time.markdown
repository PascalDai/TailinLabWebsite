title: "ZeroC: A Neuro-Symbolic Model for Zero-shot Concept Recognition and Acquisition at Inference Time"
image: "/assets/img/publications/ZeroC-2.png"
tag: "ML for discovery"
summary: We introduce a neuro-symbolic method that trained with simpler concepts and relations, can zero-shot generalize to more complex, hierarchical concepts, and transfer the knowledge across domains.
