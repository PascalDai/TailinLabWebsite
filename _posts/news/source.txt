ICLR 2023 Spotlight for our paper “Learning Controllable Adaptive Simulation for Multi-resolution Physics“.
I have been organizing a bi-weekly Reading Group on Simulation and Inverse Design, with >20 participants (Ph.Ds, postdocs, assistant professor) from CS, EE, ME, and Energy departments from Stanford, MIT, and Caltech. Each time we spend 1h discussing a relevant paper deeply (Thursday 4-5pm PT, Friday 7am Beijing time). Contact me if you want to participate!
